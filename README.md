- 👋 Hi, I’m @ecreeder! You can call me Elaine if you prefer.
- 👀 I’m interested in working for GitHub, obviously. However, I am truly interested in expanding my knowledgebase while working with great people doing exciting things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop slick sheets for individual software applications so other people in the organization will want to use them in the course of their jobs. I have also signed up for a couple courses on Udemy involving API documentation. In all my years of technical writing in the government sector, I have completely missed out on this avenue for excitement!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with developers, marketers, project managers, and customers, so that what I write is not just usable, but interesting.
- 📫 How to reach me: ecreeder@gmail.com or 571-228-2479. **Note:** Most workdays are spent in a place where I am unable to access my personal phone and email. I promise, however, that I check my email and voicemail often and am prompt in my replies.
